\begin{abstract}
Intelligent transportation relies on the Internet of Things (IoT), real-time cloud technologies, and
machine learning algorithms to manage traffic flow. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
require latency guarantees and data analytics solutions capable of ingesting and analyzing data in
real-time to produce timely signals that are suitable for the prevailing traffic conditions. As data
analytics engines migrate to virtualized environments, there is a need to preserve real-time
performance on these virtualized platforms. In this research, we introduce a model of an ITS that
predicts future traffic conditions from streaming data. This ITS is used as real-time workload in a
virtualized environment to empirically compare latency guarantees using the Xen hypervisor.
Experimental results show that the RTDS scheduler minimizes the latency of the streaming
application while maintaining real-time performance.
